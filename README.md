## ðŸªµ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Neovim 0.7.0+ (The sturdy log for your dam)
- Git (To gather materials)
- Node.js (For CoC - your building tools)
- Ripgrep (To find the perfect branches with Telescope)

### Building Your Lodge

1. Back up your existing Neovim configuration (if any):

```bash
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.backup
```

2. Clone this repository (gather your materials):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/beaver.nvim ~/.config/nvim
```

cd ~/.config/nvim && ./install.sh
```

Or install plugins manually on first run:

```bash
nvim +PlugInstall +qall
```

## ðŸª“ Key Mappings (Your Beaver Tools)

- `<Space>j` - Save file (store your wood)
- `<Space>q` - Quit (dive underwater)
- `<Space>ff` - Find files with Telescope (locate perfect branches)
- `<Space>fn` - Search in files (inspect your dam for weaknesses)
- `<Space>h` - Toggle file explorer (survey your territory)
- `<Space>gs` - Git status (check colony activities)

Check the `init.vim` file for the complete list of your beaver toolset!

## ðŸŒŠ Customization

Feel free to reinforce your dam! The main files are:

- `init.vim` - Main blueprint
- `plugins.vim` - Tools selection
- `coc-settings.json` - Specialized equipment settings

## ðŸ¦« Dam Building Philosophy

Like a beaver who carefully selects the right branches and places them perfectly to create a sturdy dam, this Neovim configuration is built with attention to detail and a focus on productivity. Every plugin and setting has been chosen to work harmoniously and create an efficient coding environment.

Efficiency, simplicity, and robustness - that's the beaver way!
